title: "Welcome to the Epiverse-CONNECT map"
---

This website offers various ways to visualize the Epiverse ecosystem of tools for pandemic and epidemic intelligence.

Through the different pages, you may be able to find new tools you may like based on tools you are already using. These new tools may:

- be created by the same set of authors as the tools you are already using
- work on the same scientific concepts as the tools you are already using
- use the same frameworks (e.g., tidyverse, stan, etc.) as the tools you are already using
- etc.
