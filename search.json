    "text": "This website offers various ways to visualize the Epiverse ecosystem of tools for pandemic and epidemic intelligence.\nThrough the different pages, you may be able to find new tools you may like based on tools you are already using. These new tools may:\n\nbe created by the same set of authors as the tools you are already using\nwork on the same scientific concepts as the tools you are already using\nuse the same frameworks (e.g., tidyverse, stan, etc.) as the tools you are already using\netc.\n\nThese different visualizations could be mixed and matched to represent various features on the same page, with a potential trade-off on decreased readability.\nSimple ways to mix and match visualizations would be to:\n\nUse a map where position has one meaning (e.g., topic similarity), and edges between nodes express another meaning (e.g., dependency relationships)\nUse positions on a given map, or connected components on the network visualizations, to create groups that are represented via different colours on another map"
